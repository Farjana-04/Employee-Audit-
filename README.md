# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

## Description:

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. 
These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). Your assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage 
a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
